# Carbon

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/graphite-project/carbon.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/graphite-project/carbon)

Carbon is one of the components of [Graphite][] ([docs][Graphite docs]), and is responsible for
receiving metrics over the network and writing them down to disk using a
storage backend. Currently [Whisper][] is our stable, supported backend and
[Ceres][] is the work-in-progress future replacement for Whisper.

The best source of documentation about Graphite and its various components currently lives [here][Graphite docs] (built from [graphite-web/docs][Graphite docs src]), but it will eventually be built from [graphite-project.github.io][Graphite github page repo].
