# Relay destination rules for carbon-relay. Entries are scanned in order,
# and the first pattern a metric matches will cause processing to cease after sending
# unless `continue` is set to true
#
#  [name]
#  pattern = <regex>
#  destinations = <list of destination addresses>
#  continue = <boolean>  # default: False
#
#  name: Arbitrary unique name to identify the rule
#  pattern: Regex pattern to match against the metric name
#  destinations: Comma-separated list of destinations with the format
#  PROTOCOL:SERVER:PORT:INSTANCE, where :INSTANCE is optional and all
#  other specific protocol defined values (like 'username' or 'queue' 
#  for the stomp protocol) should be ommitted here!
#    ex: tcp:10.1.2.1:2004, tcp:10.1.2.2:2004:b, stomp:10.1.2.3:2004, stomp:10.1.2.4:2004:c
#  continue: Continue processing rules if this rule matches (default: False)

# You must have exactly one section with 'default = true'
# Note that all destinations listed must also exist in carbon.conf
# in the DESTINATIONS setting in the [relay] section
