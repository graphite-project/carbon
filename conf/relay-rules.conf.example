#  name: Arbitrary unique name to identify the rule
#  pattern: Regex pattern to match against the metric name
#  destinations: Comma-separated list of destinations.
#    ex: 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 10.1.2.4:2004, myserver.mydomain.com:2004
#  continue: Continue processing rules if this rule matches (default: False)

# You must have exactly one section with 'default = true'
